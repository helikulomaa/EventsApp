# EventsApp

Back end application for handling event information

## Description

EventApp is a back-end application built using Spring Boot technology, providing an API for discovering local events. Users can browse events in list and map views, while event organizers can add their events to the app, which will be published upon approval by an administrator. Map data is fetched using an external API, retrieving coordinates based on address information. This project is part of a back-end programming course, focusing on building back-end applications and designing APIs.
